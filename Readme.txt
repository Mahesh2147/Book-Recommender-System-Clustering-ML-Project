Step-by-Step Code Execution
Load Libraries:

numpy and pandas for data manipulation.
Read and Explore Datasets:

Books.csv: Contains book details like title, author, year, and publisher.
Users.csv: Contains user details like user ID, location, and age.
Ratings.csv: Contains book ratings given by users.
Preprocessing:

Columns are renamed for consistency.
Dataset shapes are displayed to understand data volume.
Filtering Data Based on Criteria:

Only users who rated more than 200 books are considered.
Only books that have at least 50 ratings are included.
Creating a Book-User Matrix:

The dataset is transformed into a matrix where rows represent users, columns represent books, and values represent ratings.
Applying Similarity Measures:

Either cosine similarity or correlation-based similarity is used to find similar users or books.
Generating Recommendations:

Based on similarity, the system suggests books to users.
The most similar books to a given book or user preferences are displayed.
Insights
The system filters out less active users and unpopular books, ensuring meaningful recommendations.
Similarity-based recommendation suggests books based on either user preferences (user-based) or book similarity (item-based).
Popular books and highly active users have a stronger influence on the recommendations.
Conclusion
The recommender system effectively refines the dataset before making recommendations.
The approach likely uses collaborative filtering to suggest books based on similar users or books.
Improvements can include content-based filtering (using book descriptions) or hybrid models to enhance accuracy.
